### Overview of the Application

The goal of this application is to allow users to find the birthdate of an author based on a book title. It uses an Express server to handle web requests, a MySQL database to store and retrieve data about books and authors, and Handlebars for rendering the front-end interface.

### Application Workflow

1. **Starting the Application**:

   - When the server is started by running `node app.js`, it initiates an Express server on the local machine, listening on port 3000.

2. **Accessing the Application**:

   - Navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in a web browser, makes a GET request to the root (`/`) of the server.

3. **Rendering the Initial View** (`index.handlebars`):

   - The server responds to this request by rendering the `index.handlebars` view. This file is the main user interface and is located in the `/views` directory.
   - `index.handlebars` contains a form where users can input a book title and submit it to find the author's birthdate.

4. **User Interaction**:

   - The user enters a book title into the form and submits it. This action sends a GET request to a specific route (likely `/books` with a query parameter for the title) on your server.

5. **Server Processing** (`bookRoutes.js`):

   - The route handling this request is defined in `bookRoutes.js` within the `/routes` directory. This route uses the `Book` model to query your MySQL database for the author's birthdate based on the provided book title.

6. **Database Interaction** (`book.js` in `/models`):

   - The `Book` model, in `book.js`, contains the logic to interact with your database. It uses the `db.js` module to connect to MySQL and perform the necessary query.

7. **Response and View Update**:

   - Once the server retrieves the author's birthdate from the database, it sends the data back to the client and re-renders the `index.handlebars` view with the new information (the author's birthdate).

8. **Displaying Results**:
   - The user sees the updated view, which now includes the birthdate of the author associated with the entered book title.

### Pre-Requisites and Expectations

- **Database Setup**: Before starting the application, there should be a MySQL database set up with the necessary tables for authors and books. The database should be populated with some data to test the application effectively.
- **Environment Variables**: The `.env` file should be correctly set up with the database connection details.

- **Expected Outcome**: On navigating to `http://localhost:3000`, the user should see a form to enter a book title. Upon submission, the application should display the birthdate of the author of that book.

### Conclusion

This application is a full-stack web application utilizing the MVC architecture. It combines an Express server, MySQL database, and Handlebars templating to provide a functional and interactive experience. The user can query author information based on book titles, and the application handles these requests, interacts with the database, and dynamically updates the front-end view to display the results.
